This is a little suite of python functions for storing data on some of our friend's League of Legends data. It used to have a react project in it as well but that's been restarted [here](https://github.com/kahvilei/joebalytics). 

The main use of this data is simply doing some silly notifications to discord whenever someone gets a new mastery level.
